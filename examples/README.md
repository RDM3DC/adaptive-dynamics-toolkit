## Curated Examples

This directory now contains only a small set of maintained notebooks. Bulk auto-generated parameter sweeps were removed to keep the repository focused and lightweight.

Curated notebooks:

- `arp_vs_adam_rosenbrock.ipynb` — Optimizer comparison on Rosenbrock
- `arp_two_moons.ipynb` — ARP classifier on two-moons dataset
- `tsp_slicer_demo.ipynb` — Simple TSP / path slicing demo

Exploratory / heavier notebooks (may change):
- `arp_mnist.ipynb`, `arp_optimizer_mnist.ipynb`, `compress_text_atc.ipynb`, `compress_curve_cmc.ipynb`, `sim_adaptive_gravity_rotation_curve.ipynb`, `sim_beams_trajectory.ipynb`, `output_model.gcode`

Former bulk generation scripts were removed to keep the repo lean. If large batches of parameterized examples are needed in the future, consider creating a separate, non-versioned scratch script or a gist rather than committing outputs.
